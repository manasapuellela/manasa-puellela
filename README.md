# Hi, I'm Manasa 👋

**Python / Backend / Data Engineer** with experience across banking, healthcare, and analytics — now diving deeper into **ML research-style work, data pipelines, and model experimentation**.

### What I'm focusing on right now
- 🧠 Building small **ML experiments** in public (classification, time-series, and research-style notebooks)
- 🐍 Writing clean **Python** for data pipelines, APIs, and ETL
- ☁️ Working with **cloud + data** (AWS, SQL, analytics workflows)

### Tech I work with
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, JavaScript
- **Backend / APIs:** Django, Flask, FastAPI (learning), REST APIs, microservices
- **Data & ML:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, basic PyTorch, Jupyter/Colab
- **Cloud & Tools:** AWS (Lambda, S3, Redshift, EC2), Airflow, Docker, Git, GitHub

### What you'll see here
Over the next few weeks I'm building:
- 🔬 Small **ML research notebooks** exploring datasets end-to-end  
- ⚙️ **Data pipelines**: ingestion → cleaning → feature engineering → models  
- 📊 Simple visualizations and reports to explain results clearly

If you're from **Canopy Labs** and reviewing this profile —  
I'm especially excited about roles where I can:
- Work on **data pipelines + model training/inference**
- Collaborate closely with **researchers & product engineers**
- Help turn **experiments into reliable systems**
