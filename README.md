# 🌟 Hi, I'm **Manasa**

**Software Engineer | Python Developer | Data & Analytics Engineer | AI Enthusiast**  
I build reliable backend systems, clean data pipelines, and practical AI-driven solutions.

---

## 🚀 What I Do
- Build backend services using **Python** (Django / Flask / FastAPI)
- Design **data pipelines**, ETL workflows, and automation processes  
- Work with **REST APIs**, cloud-native architecture, and microservices  
- Develop **ML workflows**: data prep → feature engineering → model training  
- Experiment with **LLMs**, embeddings, vector search, and inference pipelines  
- Write clean, maintainable, well-tested code for production environments

---

## 🧠 Current Focus
- Strengthening **AI engineering** foundations: model training, evaluation, inference  
- Building small, reproducible **ML and AI projects** (classical ML + LLMs)  
- Implementing **backend + AI integrations** (API-based inference, RAG, embeddings)  
- Enhancing cloud skills for **scalable data + ML workflows**  
- Growing my GitHub footprint through consistent, meaningful projects
